# LP-Capstone-Project

Project that uses old and new Python techniques I learned over the past two years
My program features a login page with a pre-made username and password, generating a small list of names in the background upon logging in.
# Target Audience
My target audience was parents who want an efficient way to manage their family's money.
# Purpose
This "app" would allow the parent/guardian to view all connected balances. The parent can then deposit or withdraw money from these accounts as much as they want.
# Function
The most important components of my project are the loops I am using, being two VERY simple equations that keep the code running until I break, which would be done by logging out. The next important thing in my project is the API I used, which gave me a large list of names I can shuffle through with random.shuffle to get different sets of names.
# Plans
One thing I wish I could have added was the ability to use other usernames and passwords, given that only my preset details work.
