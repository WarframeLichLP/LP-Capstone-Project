# Purpose
This "app" would allow the parent/guardian to view all connected balances. The parent can then deposit or withdraw money from these accounts as much as they want.
# LP-Capstone-Project
A project that uses old and new Python techniques I learned over the past two years. 
My program features a login page with a pre-made username and password. Upon logging in, a small list of names is generated in the background.
# Target Audience
My target audience was parents who want an efficient way to manage their family's money.
# Key Components
I used an API to give me a variety of names for my program, followed by a few while loops to keep the code running until the user "logs out" of the "account".
# "Timeline"
On the last day of January 2025, I was tasked with writing my own code to construct a project that held some sort of classified data. My way of doing this was making a login page that led to a joined bank, where the parent could oversee the bank balances of their children. I decided to expand on this idea months later, inserting an API to generate random kid names for more variety in each use of my project.
# Challenges
The biggest challenges in making the Family Bank were attempting to update the code via API, and figuring out how to keep the code running until a user chooses to exit.
# Function
The most important components of my project are the loops I am using, being two VERY simple equations that keep the code running until I break, which would be done by logging out. The next important thing in my project is the API I used, which gave me a large list of names I can shuffle through with random.shuffle to get different sets of names.
# Tools/Resources I used
A well-optimized use of teacher assistance to insert my API. The coding platform I used to code this project was TechSmart.
# Plans
One thing I wish I could have added was the ability to use other usernames and passwords, given that only my preset details work.
